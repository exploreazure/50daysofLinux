# 50daysofLinux

Hi, I'm Barry and this is my 50 Days of Linux Challenge

## The Goal
I am looking to learn more about Linux, at the same time I will share my notes with the community. I am studying towards the [Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator exam ](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/linux-foundation-certified-sysadmin-lfcs/). However, my end goal isn't to pass the exam, its to learn more about Linux. Passing the exam will be a bonus.

Today is 7th May 2022, its day one of my Linux learning journey. Hope you find my notes useful.

Let the studying begin...
