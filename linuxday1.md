Navigation Commands

The Linux file system follows a tree-like hierarchial structure. However, the tree is upside down, as the root is the top-level directory.


To list files and directories use ls

```
ls
```

The -l will output in long format, as the default will only show the names of the files. The long listing format is much more helpful.

```
ls -l
```

In Linux there are hidden files, they have prefixed with a fullstop to show hidden files use ls -a. The below command combines the log listing option and hidden files option:
